# Let's Give Your Students an Unfair Advantage

## 1. The Challenge: Information Overload is Real

Right now, where do your students find placement information? Is it buried in scattered PDFs, outdated web pages, or passed down through word-of-mouth?

Students are already juggling classes, exams, and projects. The last thing they need is to hunt for basic information about hiring processes, salary expectations, or required skills. They need a single, reliable source they can turn to anytime.

This is where we can make a real difference.

## 2. The Solution: "Connecto," Your 24/7 AI Career Expert

Imagine giving every single one of your students a dedicated career assistant—one that never sleeps, is always up-to-date, and can instantly answer their most pressing questions about placements.

That's **Connecto**.

It's an intelligent, conversational AI chatbot built from the ground up to serve one purpose: to help your students get ahead. It's not a generic chatbot; it's a specialist, trained on *your* curated data to provide context-aware information about company hiring processes.

## 3. The "Aha!" Moment: How It Works

So, what makes Connecto special? It's all about being smart and simple.

*   **It Just Works:** Students can ask questions naturally, in plain English ("what's the salary for a fresher at TCS?" or "tell me about the infosys interview process"). The chatbot understands context and can even handle follow-up questions.

*   **It's Infinitely Scalable (Without a Tech Team):** This is the best part. The chatbot's entire knowledge base is powered by simple `.txt` files. To add a new company, you just add a new text file. That's it. You could have 10 companies or 500—the process is the same. No code changes needed.

*   **It's Fast & Accurate:** We use a unique "two-brain" AI system. One AI is an expert router that instantly figures out which company the student is asking about. It then hands off *only* that specific company's file to the second AI, which is an expert at generating clear, concise answers. This makes it incredibly efficient and prevents the AI from getting confused.

*   **It's Practically Free to Run:** Because it's built on a modern, serverless platform, there are no idle server costs. You only pay for what you use, which keeps operational expenses extremely low.

## 4. The Partnership: Your One-Time Investment

## 5. Optional: Keep It Running Smoothly (Your Peace of Mind)

To ensure Connecto stays secure, up-to-date, and completely hands-off for your team, I offer two simple monthly support plans.

### The "Keep the Lights On" Plan
Perfect for ensuring the app is always secure and operational without needing your technical oversight.
*   **What you get:** Proactive monitoring, all necessary software and security updates, and email support for any technical questions.

### The "VIP Treatment" Plan
My recommended option. You get all the benefits of the maintenance plan, but you never have to touch a file.
*   **What you get:** Everything from the "Keep the Lights On" plan, **plus** I will personally handle up to 5 content updates per month for you. Just email me the text, and I'll take care of the rest.
*   **Investment: ₹3,000 / month**
