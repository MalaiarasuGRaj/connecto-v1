# Project Proposal: "Connecto" AI Career Assistant

---

## 1. Project Overview

This document outlines the proposal for the delivery of **Connecto**, an intelligent, conversational AI chatbot designed to serve as a dedicated career assistant. Its primary purpose is to provide your users—be they students or job seekers—with instant, accurate, and context-aware information about company hiring processes, salary expectations, required skills, and available roles.

The application has been built from the ground up on a modern, serverless architecture designed for high performance and scalability.

### Key Features Delivered:

*   **Natural Conversational Interface:** Users can ask questions naturally, including follow-ups, as the chatbot maintains the context of the conversation.
*   **Scalable Knowledge Base:** The chatbot's knowledge is sourced directly from simple text files. This means your team can add information for hundreds of companies without writing a single line of code.
*   **Efficient & Accurate:** A unique two-step AI process first identifies the user's topic from the knowledge base and then generates a focused answer, ensuring high accuracy and performance.
*   **Cost-Effective Operation:** The application is built on a serverless platform, meaning there are no fixed server costs, and the AI usage is billed on a pay-as-you-go basis, resulting in extremely low operational expenses.
